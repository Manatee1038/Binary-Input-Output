For this assignment, I used Câ€™s input/output functions to create a simple course catalog database for administrators to update the details of each course offered by the CS department. 
The system will storebasic information about each course, allowing the user to create, read, update, and delete them. 
All information for all courses will be stored as binary records in a single file.
